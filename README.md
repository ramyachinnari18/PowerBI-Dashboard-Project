# PowerBI-Dashboard-Project
An interactive Power BI dashboard for monitoring credit risk models using metrics like Gini coefficient, PSI, CSI, and bad rate. Enables quarter-wise analysis, variable stability tracking, and visual insights for model performance evaluation.

# Credit Risk Monitoring Dashboard – Power BI

## 📊 Overview
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate and monitor credit risk model performance using key statistical indicators. The dashboard is designed for retail underwriting teams, risk analysts, and data scientists in the banking and financial services domain.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧩 PSI (Population Stability Index) and CSI (Characteristic Stability Index) for variable-level monitoring.
- 📈 Gini Coefficient calculation using AUROC method for each quarter.
- 📉 Bad Rate visualization across Score Bands.
- 🕹️ Slicer-enabled dynamic filtering (Quarter, Variable Name, Score Bands).
- 🔁 Quarter-wise comparisons with model development vs. out-of-time (OOT) datasets.

## 🏗️ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Excel** (as data source)


## 📊 Key Metrics
- **Gini Coefficient**: Measures model's discriminatory power.
- **PSI/CSI**: Detects data drift and stability at variable level.
- **Bad Rate**: % of defaults per score band.

## 🧠 Business Use Case
Retail banking credit teams can use this dashboard to:
- Monitor changes in customer profiles or model input variables.
- Ensure model predictions remain consistent and stable over time.
- Trigger revalidation if instability is detected.

## 📸 Sample Visuals
Screenshots of the dashboard can be found in the `Screenshots/` folder.
